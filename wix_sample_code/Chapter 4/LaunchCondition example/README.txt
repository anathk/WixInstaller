This example demonstrates using launch conditions to check for prerequisites for the install. It checks the 
following:
   A. .NET Framework 4.5 is installed
   B. The operating system is Windows Vista or later
   C. The installed version of PowerShell is at least 1.0

To run this example:

1. Compile the project in Visual Studio
2. Run the installer to see if any of the launch conditions are displayed
